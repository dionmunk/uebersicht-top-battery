# Top Battery Usage

A top battery usage widget for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/). It lists the five processes with the highest energy impact, each with its name, PID, and power score (macOS's energy-impact measure, the same one Activity Monitor's Energy tab uses). Colors are theme-aware, with sensible built-in defaults, so the widget works on its own.

## Installation

- Download the [repository](https://github.com/dionmunk/uebersicht-top-battery/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
- Place the `top-battery.widget` folder in your Übersicht extension folder.
- Refresh Übersicht.

## Theming

This widget is theme-aware. Its colors come from CSS custom properties (text, panel tint, status and series colors) with sensible built-in fallbacks, so it looks right on its own. Install the [Theme Controller](https://github.com/dionmunk/uebersicht-theme-controller) widget and this one automatically follows its color scheme and light/dark mode, staying in sync with the rest of the collection.
